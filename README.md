# Ethereum - Serpent Tutorial and Smart Contract Lab
This repository contains tutorials intended for instructors who wish to conduct a smart
contract programming lab, or students/developers who want to learn about smart contract
programming.

The serpent tutorial and smart contract lab are located in [Guides/](Guides/) and the full serpent contract examples are in [Examples/](Examples/).

The corresponding makefile for the two `.tex`files is also in [Guides/](Guides/).

The lab uses [pyethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/pyethereum). Detailed download instructions can be found on pyethereum's 
github or you can follow instructions in [Guides/serpent_tutorial.tex](Guides/serpent_tutorial.tex) to install our preconfigured VM-image. ([download .zip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzlG8wGYwTrGODVPZmFUV1UyYlk/view?usp=sharing))

Open course materials and lab designs for smart contract programming are in [Ethereumlab: Towards Safe Smart Contracts](http://mc2-umd.github.io/ethereumlab/)
